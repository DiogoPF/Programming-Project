Patients with MS who had lower vitamin D levels were at increased risk for more clinical attacks and faster disease progression. It was also shown that patients with MS had lower vitamin D levels in serum than heathy controls. It is not clearly defined, which are the levels of vitamin D in serum, that are high enough to trigger immunomodulatory effect and are safe for patients. This double-blind randomised clinical trial was designed to compare impact of vitamin D supplemetation in two different doses (1000 IU/day vs 4000 IU/day) in patients with relapsing remitting MS. The main goal of this trial is to show, which dose triggers immunomodulatory effect and it will be suitable for patients with MS to use during winter time, when the vitamin D levels are especially low. To define immunomodulatory response different laboratory, clinical and genetic tests will be performed.  Vitamin D je pomemben dejavnik tveganja za nastanek in potek multiple skleroze (MS). Bolniki z MS, ki so imeli nižje vrednosti vitamina D v krvi, so utrpeli več kliničnih zagonov in hitrejši progres bolezni. Ti bolniki imajo že v osnovi nižje vrednosti vitamina D v krvi kot zdrava populacija. Kljub vsem raziskavam pa še vedno ni jasno, kateri je tisti nivo vitamina D v serumu, ki sproži imunomodulatorni učinek in je hkrati varen za bolnike. Ta randomizirana dvojno slepa raziskava je bila zasnovana z namenom, da primerja vpliv nadomeščanja vitamina D v dveh različnih odmerkih (1000IU/dan in 4000IU/dan) pri bolnikih z recidivno remitentno obliko MS. Glavni cilj je dokazati, kateri od teh dveh odmerkov je tisti, ki sproži imunomodulatorni učinek in bi bil primeren za nadomeščanje tekom zimskih mesecev, ko so vrednosti vitamina D v krvi bolnikov z MS še posebej nizke.

Angiotensin II is a small molecule that is already well known for being responsible for the contraction of blood vessels which in turn increases blood pressure. More recent evidence over the last decades has come to light of how angiotensin II is also very promiscuous in biochemical terms. Angiotensin II (or Ang II) is very involved in processes that increase inflammation; it inhibits the release of the chemical acetylcholine which is vital for memory formation in the brain; it is heavily involved with how cells regulate calcium levels which in turn can impact on levels of cell death and the activation of other mechanisms that also damage cells.

Specifically, we wish to determine the effects of discontinuing vs. continuing statins on the risk of recurrent symptomatic ICH. We hypothesize that discontinuation of statins in patients with lobar ICH is likely associated with reduced risk of ICH recurrence.  SAFETY - To determine the effects of continuation vs. discontinuation of statins on the occurrence of any of the following MACCE (symptomatic ischemic stroke, symptomatic myocardial infarction, newly symptomatic arterial occlusive disease (peripheral, retinal, or carotid), revascularization procedures for coronary, carotid, or peripheral arterial disease, and vascular death). EFICACIA - Determinar los efectos de la continuación frente a la interrupción de las estatinas sobre el riesgo de recurrencia de la HIC durante 24 meses de seguimiento en pacientes que presentan una HIC lobar espontánea mientras toman una estatina. Específicamente, deseamos determinar los efectos de discontinuar versus continuar con las estatinas sobre el riesgo de HIC sintomática recurrente. Presumimos que la interrupción de las estatinas en pacientes con HIC lobular probablemente se asocie con un riesgo reducido de recurrencia de la HIC.

It could also help monitor the effect of potential new drugs in clinical trials. Anti-amyloid drugs have indeed failed to prove effective in patients with AD dementia. Tau can also be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, this requires performing a lumbar puncture, a procedure that is more invasive than a PET scan and that does not allow to visualize where tau accumulates in the brain. As neurological symptoms depend on the topography of brain lesions, it is likely that the specific cognitive domains (language, memory...) in which an individual will have impairment will depend on the topography of tau deposition.",Diagnosis,Therapeutic exploratory (Phase II),Adults (18-64 years),"Female, Male"

ON is an inflammation of the optic nerve (the nerve that carries signals from the eye) and is a common event in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a disease in which there are episodes of inflammation in either or all of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerves (optic neuritis). These episodes generally recover, however following an episode some of the nerve cells are lost. Loss of nerve cells is an important underlying reason for patients with MS to develop disability. In ON this loss of nerve cells can be easily visualised by non-invasive scanning techniques (Optical coherence tomography [OCT] and Scanning laser polarimetry[GDx]) that measure the thickness of the nervous tissue at the back of the eye, known as the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL).

To investigate the brain correlates of rehabilitation (rehab)-related clinical benefits on upper limb function in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and to qualify imaging markers associated with performance improvements.

Rehab-mediated improvements may be associated with brain functional changes in sensorimotor regions that can be measured with neuroimaging methods.  2. To enhance rehab-mediated functional recovery in MS by pharmacological modulation of brain plasticity. Pharmacological modulation of brain plasticity aims to predispose sensorimotor systems to rehab effects, improving and prolonging rehab effect in MS. The association of a drug to physical intervention will test this hypothesis. 1.

People with optic neuritis lose vision in the eye affected by the disorder, and vision may not recover fully. Current therapy for optic neuritis can lead to a faster recovery of vision, but does not improve the extent to which vision would recover eventually without treatment. Recent work suggests that loss of vision is due to damage to the nerve fibres in the optic nerve (which is accompanied by damage to the nerve fibres in the retina), that the damage is secondary to a buildup of sodium in these fibres, and that it can be prevented by blocking the entry of sodium into them. In this clinical trial, the principal objective is to assess whether immediate and sustained blockade of the entry of sodium into nerve fibres with the drug phenytoin protects nerve fibres in the retina and optic nerve from degeneration after an attack of optic neuritis.","Therapy, Safety, Efficacy",Therapeutic exploratory (Phase II),Adults (18-64 years),"Female, Male"
