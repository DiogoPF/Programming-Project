The aim of the present study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect. The questions to be addressed are i) if women with PMDD display differences in blod and/or CSF between the symptomatic (premenstrual) and the asymptomatic (postmenstrual) cyclic phase regarding levels of gonadal steroids, neurosteroids, inflammatory markers or various markers of brain neurotransmission, ii) to which extent these parameters correlate with each other and/or symptom intensity and iii) to what extent these parameters are affected by treatment with escitalopram. Det är känt att serotoninåterupptagshämmaren escitalopram har gynnsam effekt vid premenstruellt dysforiskt syndrom. Syftet med den aktuella studien är att undersöka mekanismerna bakom denna effekt. Frågeställningarna är i) om det, hos kvinnor med PMDS, går att identifiera skillnader i blod och/eller ryggmärgsvätska mellan symptomatisk (premenstruell) och aymptomatisk (postmenstruell) cykelfas i blod och/eller ryggmärgsvätska vad avser nivåer av könshormoner, neurosteroider, inflammatoriska markörer eller markörer för central nervtransmission, ii) i vad mån dessa parametrar korrelerar med varandra och/eller med symtomintensiteten och iii) i vad mån dessa parametrar påverkas av behandling med escitalopram.",,Therapeutic use (Phase IV),Adults (18-64 years),Female

On a molecular level modulation of the protein kinase B and glycogen synthase kinase 3 signalling pathway by various G-protein coupled receptors has been discussed. Dopamine and serotonine receptors play a major role. In humans these two transmitter systems are accessible via PET. Emotional and cognitive functions can non-invasively be explored by fMRI. With MR-spectroscopy at ultra-high field lithium in the brain becomes quantitatively assessable. Imaging at ultra-high fields also opens up avenues for advanced sodium imaging. One hypothesis about the efficacy of lithium states that it balances the intracellular sodium concentration. A multimodal imaging approach is required to elucidate lithium working mechanisms. Our bilateral project aims to elucidate the pathophysiology of lithium in 40 healthy volun-teers (20m/20f) and 40 euthymic bipolar patients type 1 (20m/20f, 2 groups: monotherapy with lithium / lithium naive). Eine sehr effiziente Behandlung bipolarer Störungen stellt die Medikation mit Lithium dar. Signale von D2-Rezeptoren, Serotoninrezeptoren und anderen G-Protein-gekoppelten Rezeptoren spielen eine wichtige Rolle im Lithium vermittelten Signalweg. Bei Menschen sind diese Transmittersysteme über PET spezifisch untersuchbar. Emotionale und kognitive Funktionen können nicht-invasiv durch fMRT untersucht werden. Mit dem Beginn der Ultra-Hochfeld-Bildgebung wird es möglich, die Lithium-Konzentration mittels Spektroskopie zu messen. Es eröffnen sich neue Perspektiven für die Natriumbildgebung. Eine Hypothese über die Effektivität von Lithium lautet, dass Lithium die intrazelluläre Sodiumkonzentration steuert. Auf diesen Grundlagen basiert der multimodale Untersuchungsansatz dieses Projektes. Unser bilaterales Projekt untersucht die Wirkweise von Lithium in 40 gesunden Probanden (20m/20w) und euthymen Patienten mit Bipolarer Störung Typ 1 (20m/20w, Monotherapie mit Lithium vs. Lithium naiv).",,Therapeutic use (Phase IV),Adults (18-64 years),"Female, Male"

Results showed that this positive interpretation bias led to an increase in children's trust in maternal support, one of the core concepts of attachment. In the current study, we want to investigate whether we can increase the training effect using oxytocin. Oxytocin is a substance that has been associated with social learning, trust, and attachment. Thus, it seems like a prime candidate to increase the training effect. Children will be administered either a single dose of oxytocin or a placebo substance and then complete either the experimental or the placebo training. This will allow us to examine whether oxytocin results in significantly more positive training effect.  In voorgaand onderzoek door onze onderzoeksgroep werd reeds aangetoond dat het mogelijk is om met behulp van een computergestuurde training kinderen te leren om ambigue gedrag van moeder op een positieve manier te interpreteren. Deze positieve interpretatie bias zorgde voor een toename in het vertrouwen van kinderen in steun van hun moeder. De opzet van het huidige onderzoek is om na te gaan of dit trainingseffect versterkt kan worden door het gebruik van oxytocine. Oxytocine is een stof die meermaals in verband is gebracht met sociaal leren, vertrouwen en gehechtheid. Oxytocine lijkt daarom een uitstekende kandidaat om het trainingseffect te versterken. Kinderen zullen een éénmalige dosis van ofwel oxytocine ofwel een placebo toegediend krijgen en zullen daarna ofwel de werkzame training ofwel een placebo training doorlopen. Op deze manier kan nagegaan worden of het gebruik van oxytocine tot een groter effect van de training leidt.",Therapy,Therapeutic use (Phase IV),"Children (2-11years), Adolescents (12-17 years)","Female, Male"

Previous research found that oxytocin attenuates prediction error which suggests that oxytocin can affect plasticity. Based on the LTA, we specify concrete hypotheses and by manipulating contingency in different trials, we can assess how oxytocin affects trust learning on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, we want to assess whether the effect of oxytocin also extends to a more basic level. Secondly, because of the potential attenuating effect of oxytocin on the encoding of prediction error, we will focus on the dopamine system as explanatory mechanism. Previous research pointed to a crucial role for the dopamine system in updating of safety conditioning and encoding prediction error. In deze studie baseren we ons op de ""Learning Theory of Attachment (LTA)"" om de rol van oxytocine in de ontwikkeling van gehechtheid te onderzoeken. Deze theorie stelt dat de ontwikkeling van gehechtheid gedeeltelijk verklaard kan worden als resultaat van een leerproces. Eerder onderzoek vond dat oxytocine predictiefouten vermindert, wat suggereert dat oxytocine plasticiteit kan beïnvloeden. Gebaseerd op de LTA, kunnen we concrete hypotheses maken en door het manipuleren van contingentie in verschillende trials, kunnen we nagaan hoe oxytocine het leren van vertrouwen beïnvloedt. Verder willen we nagaan of het effect van oxytocine ook een meer basaal niveau van leren beïnvloedt. Ten tweede, vanwege het mogelijke effect van oxytocine op het verwerken van predictiefouten, zullen we ons richten op het dopaminesysteem als verklarend mechanisme.

Pharmacotherapeutic conditioning enables to alternate standard MTX dosing with lower MTX doses, by utilizing learning effects (conditioning). By this, children with JIA will be less affected by MTX related side effects, without compromising for its therapeutic efficacy. A reduction in side effects will be assessed by intolerance percentages as defined by a cutoff score of ≥ 6 on the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score (MISS) questionnaire. Het doel van deze studie is om bijwerkingen te verminderen door middel van farmacotherapeutisch conditioneren bij patiënten met JIA. Farmacotherapeutisch conditioneren biedt de mogelijkheid om MTX doseringen af te wisselen met lagere doseringen. Door het afwisselend doseren wordt gebruik gemaakt van de leereffecten van het medicijn (conditioneren). Hierdoor zullen mogelijk minder kinderen last hebben van bijwerkingen doordat lagere MTX doseringen gebruikt kunnen worden voor de behandeling van JIA, zonder dat dit ten koste zal gaan van de ziekteactiviteit.

(2) Is CBT more effective in PAR than CM+PL? (3) Is CBT not less effective in PAR than CM+ARI?  If PRQ 1-3 will be answered positively, there will be substantial empirical evidence for SPS. Moreover, the results will suggest that AN and CBT are comparable effective. Thus PAR will benefit from a choice of prevention strategies. Thereby acceptance, tolerance and compliance with SPS efforts in PAR, in their families and in the general population is likely to improve.

We predict that blocking P2X7 will be beneficial for depressed patients who have not responded completely to standard anti-depressant drugs and who have blood test results at screening which indicate high levels of P2X7 activity.
