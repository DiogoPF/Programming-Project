#### Scrapper Bots:

- RNEC Scrapper - Gets trial info from RNEC and stores it in an csv file named [RNEC](https://github.com/Dpf050/Programming-Project/blob/59d364b01eb7bc6cc0d765ac57d1de6b4c7d65e3/DataSets/RNEC.csv).
- EUCTRegister - Gets trial info from EUCTRegister (multiple files) and merges them into one. Due to GitHub file constrictions they are stored in: [EU_data.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TlMjoSPUPPzriZOIh_PvQjVAw3Pml0nx/view?usp=share_link)(all files by batch) [EUCTRegister](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lo6zbyhzTMww79L3ssETF51_E8rUqZi_/view?usp=share_link)(merged csv).
- Health life years - Script to get eurostat excel file regarding [Health Life Years](https://github.com/Dpf050/Programming-Project/blob/744abdc3d2ea6aff87ff4cba54e512fafb962381/DataSets/Healthy%20Life%20Years.xlsx).
- Life Expectancy - Script to get eurostat excel file regarding [Life Expectancy](https://github.com/Dpf050/Programming-Project/blob/744abdc3d2ea6aff87ff4cba54e512fafb962381/DataSets/Life%20Expectancy.xlsx).

 (TG message - small script with function to send message through telegram in case the scrapers stop )
